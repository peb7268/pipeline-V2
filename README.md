#Pipeline

A ficticious ( as of this moment ) productivity salesforce / wunderlist type app built in mean.io & socket.io. This is mostly a play project to learn with.

##Notes to self
To start this app, make sure the port forwarding is turned on and the hostfile entry for pipeline.com is added.
Then start mongo, start the app with clear; gulp. 

sudo pfctl -ef /etc/pf-dev.conf
